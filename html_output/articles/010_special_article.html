A Suitcase and a Mission
On a brisk Lillehammer evening in June 2025, 
Dmitri Strotsev stood under the bright lights 
of the World Expression Forum (WEXFO) 
stage, speaking in his native Belarusian. Just 
moments earlier, he had been handed the IPA 
Prix Voltaire – a prestigious international 
award for courage in publishing – jointly 
with fellow Belarusian publisher Nadia 
Kandrusevich. Accepting the honor, Strotsev 
recounted the day he fled Belarus: “In March 
2022, I left for the West with one small 
suitcase. I was fleeing political persecution, but 
I was also preparing for a new mission — to 
use thirty years of publishing experience to 
create a free Belarusian publishing house in 
exile”. Those gathered in the Norwegian hall 
fell silent, hanging on his every word.
Strotsev’s journey from Minsk to Berlin – 
from prisoner to Prix Voltaire laureate – is 
as extraordinary as it is heartbreaking. Back 
home in Belarus, his independent publishing 
house had its license stripped by authorities. 
Undeterred, he operated underground, 
printing books in secret and circulating 
forbidden Belarusian literature samizdat-style 
to readers hungry for uncensored words.
In October 2020, amid the regime’s brutal 
post-election crackdown, Strotsev was arrested 
and threatened for his work. By early 2022, 
facing mounting harassment, he made the 
painful decision to flee. “I left… with one 
small suitcase,” he told the WEXFO audience. 
He eventually found refuge in Germany and 
founded a new press in exile, Hochroth Minsk, 
as a platform where Belarusian writers could 
publish freely once again.
Even in exile, Strotsev did not work alone. 
“Today, about thirty Belarusian publishing 
houses have re-emerged or restored their 
work in exile, and we are all closely connected. 
We have a publishing community,” he said, 
describing a remarkable phenomenon – an 
entire literary culture uprooted and replanted 
abroad. Scattered across Europe, these exiled 
publishers share manuscripts, and resources: 
to ensure Belarusian stories survive beyond 
the reach of an authoritarian state.
Strotsev’s voice cracked with emotion as 
he thanked the International Publishers 
Association for the Voltaire Prize: “This 
is important support for the Belarusian 
democratic resistance; this is an open 
invitation to Belarusian independent 
publishers to join the global publishing family. 
In the audience, many wiped away tears. It 
was clear that this award – more than the CHF 
10,000 prize money or the trophy – signified 
to Strotsev and his colleagues that the world 
hears them, that they are not forgotten.
The Quiet Power of Words
Hundreds of kilometers away, in a safe house 
somewhere in Poland, Nadia Kandrusevich 
watched a live stream of the Lillehammer 
ceremony. Unable to travel to Norway, she 
had sent a statement that was read aloud as 
she and her family huddled around a laptop. 
Kandrusevich, founder of the Belarusian 
children’s publisher Koska, spoke of hope in 
the face of oppression. “Thank you for the 
great honor of receiving the Prix Voltaire,” her 
message began softly. “This recognition affirms 
not only the importance of publishing and 
translating books for children but the belief 
in the quiet power of words to shape minds, 
to open hearts, and to build bridges across 
languages, cultures, and generations” For 
Kandrusevich, who specializes in books for 
Belarusian youngsters, the act of storytelling 
itself has become a gentle form of defiance. 
“Even the smallest readers deserve stories</p>

that speak truth… This award belongs to all 
the translators, publishers, and writers who 
keep working despite all circumstances,” her 
statement continued, “to all the children who 
read or listen to bedtime stories and to all the 
parents who believe in the power of a good 
book.”
Those words carry the weight of 
Kandrusevich’s own experience. She founded 
Koska Books in 2018 with a simple dream: 
to give children access to literature in the 
Belarusian language—literature full of 
imagination and free thought. But under 
President Alexander Lukashenko’s regime, 
even that became a subversive act. Belarus’s 
publishing market is dominated by Russian-
language books, and independent presses face 
strict state controls.
After Lukashenko’s disputed re-election in 
2020 sparked mass protests, the government 
turned ever more hostile to Belarusian-
language culture. Any publisher promoting 
Belarusian national identity, printing history 
books that challenged official narratives, or 
simply releasing books in the Belarusian 
tongue became a target. “In 2020, Belarus’ 
government intensified its campaign of 
censoring publishers that promoted Belarusian 
identity, language, or history, or published 
texts in Belarusian,” notes an IPA report on the 
country’s worsening climate.
Kandrusevich lived this crackdown firsthand: 
police seized Koska’s publications, and officials 
threatened to shut her office down. Imagine 
picture books – storybook tales for kids – 
being treated as dangerous contraband simply 
because they were printed in Belarusian. 
As unrest roiled the nation, Kandrusevich 
realized even her gentle mission put her in 
peril.
By 2021, the pressure was unbearable.

(after a stop in Poland), carrying with her 
the manuscripts and artwork of upcoming 
children’s books. In exile, she refused to let 
Koska die. Since 2022 she has continued her 
work abroad, still managing to send new 
Belarusian books to children back home – 
often through underground networks and 
brave volunteers who smuggle storybooks 
across the border.
Language, Censorship, and Resistance 
in Belarus
In Belarus, the sidelining of the Belarusian 
language and the promotion of Russian 
is a result of decades of political choices 
rooted in identity politics, Soviet legacy, and 
authoritarian control, says a Belarusian literary 
friend of Jaffna Monitor who wished to remain 
anonymous—for obvious reasons.
He went on to explain that after Belarus gained 
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, 
there was a brief cultural revival. Belarusian 
was declared the sole state language, and 
efforts were made to reintroduce it in schools, 
media, and public life. But all of that changed 
dramatically when Alexander Lukashenko—
who still holds power today and is often 
described as Europe’s last dictator—came to 
power in 1994.
Lukashenko, a former state farm director with 
strong Soviet leanings, won the country’s first 
post-Soviet presidential election by projecting 
himself as an anti-corruption populist who 
promised stability amid economic chaos. 
But once in power, he quickly consolidated 
authority and steered Belarus back toward 
Moscow’s orbit.
Lukashenko openly championed a pan-Slavic 
identity—an ideology that envisions the unity 
of Slavic nations, particularly under Russian 
leadership. In this worldview, the Belarusian 
language is seen as provincial or divisive, 
while Russian is portrayed as a unifying and 
"superior" Slavic tongue.

In 1995, Lukashenko held a controversial 
referendum that made Russian an official 
language alongside Belarusian. But as our 
source explained, “Though both were declared 
official, the real motive was clear: to push 
Belarusian into the background and re-
establish Russian as the dominant language in 
all spheres of life.”
Our source continued: “There were several 
reasons for this shift. Throughout the 20th 
century, Russian was the language of power, 
prestige, and education in Soviet Belarus. 
In contrast, Belarusian was associated with 
peasants and the rural poor. Russian was 
spoken by the educated; and Belarusian by 
the common folk. That created a lasting 
perception—Russian was modern, Belarusian 
was backward.”
But beyond the colonial hangover, the true 
reason, he said, lies in raw political control. 
“Lukashenko’s deep attachment to Russian 
over his own mother tongue reflects his 
willingness to go to any extent to remain in 
power,” the source told us. Promoting Russian 
ensured tighter alignment with Moscow and 
helped Lukashenko stay in the Kremlin’s good 
books, thus keeping Belarus within Russia’s 
geopolitical grip.
“He knew that reviving the Belarusian 
language would inevitably lead to a revival of 
Belarusian nationalism,” our source said. “And 
with it, a stronger sense of national identity—
something that could eventually threaten his 
rule. He was never going to let that happen.”
To suppress that possibility, Lukashenko 
systematically undermined Belarusian culture.

He publicly called the language “primitive” and 
“unnecessary”. That mindset, combined with 
deliberate policies to underfund Belarusian-
language schools and media, gradually pushed 
the language out of public life.
“Today, most Belarusians speak Russian at 
home, especially in the cities,” he explained. 
“Schools operate mostly in Russian. Belarusian 
is now mostly confined to poetry, folklore, 
or nationalist activism. Speaking, writing, or 
publishing in Belarusian today is more than 
just a cultural choice—it is an act of quiet 
resistance.”
In late 2020 and 2021, authorities raided 
publishing houses, confiscating books printed 
in Belarusian and jailing publishers on 
trumped-up “extremism” charges. The very 
act of printing in Belarusian – one of Europe’s 
oldest languages – had been criminalized.
It was during this frenzy of repression that 
Belarus’s independent publishing community 
essentially went into exile. Some fled to Poland, 
Lithuania, or Ukraine; others to Germany 
or Sweden. They carried with them boxes of 
books and hard drives full of manuscripts.
Inside Belarus, the regime tries to fill the 
void with state-sanctioned, mostly Russian-
language material. But clandestinely, many 
Belarusians seek out the literature of their 
own language. Every time a Belarusian 
buys a smuggled book of local poetry, or 
a parent surreptitiously reads their child a 
Belarusian bedtime story, Lukashenko’s effort 
to erase a national identity is subverted. 
As one Belarusian poet noted, “preserving 
the Belarusian language and culture [is] 
continuing their fight for a democratic and 
truly independent country”. In Belarus today, 
publishing in Belarusian has truly become a 
form of political resistance – a way of saying 
we exist in the face of a regime that wishes 
otherwise.
A Ceremony of Solidarity and Hope
Back in Lillehammer, as the 2025 IPA Prix 
Voltaire ceremony drew to a close, the 
significance of the moment extended far 
beyond the two Belarusian laureates. The 
WEXFO gathering itself bore the theme “Year 
of Resistance,” and there could hardly be a 
more fitting embodiment of literary resistance 
than Kandrusevich and Strotsev. “In this 
story of resistance, we all are also characters. 
2025 IPA Prix Voltaire laureates are central 
characters,” said Gvantsa Jobava, the IPA 
President, praising the pair. “At great personal 
risk, they are inspiring hope, demanding 
reflection, carrying culture. It is an honor to 
celebrate them.”
In the crowd was a Palestinian bookseller 
whose shop in Gaza was bombed and rebuilt; a 
Turkish publisher who had endured prison for 
printing “unpatriotic” novels; an Afghan editor 
who evacuated her entire press staff when the 
Taliban took over.
The Prix Voltaire, awarded annually by the 
International Publishers Association, has 
highlighted such heroes from every corner of 
the world. Past laureates include Belarus’s own 
Ihar Lohvinau (2014), whose Minsk bookshop 
was shut down for selling an “undesirable” 
photo album, Mazin Lateef Ali of Iraq (2023), 
who disappeared after publishing books on 
government corruption, and Samir Mansour 
of Palestine (2024), who rebuilt his Gaza 
bookshop from rubble only to see it targeted 
yet again in war. By honoring Kandrusevich 
and Strotsev in 2025, the award shone a 
spotlight on Belarus’s plight and sent a message 
of solidarity: the free world stands with those 
who risk everything to keep truth alive in 
print.</p>
